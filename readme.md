Why this project?
----------

- Wanted to learn flask by coding because; ``practice makes perfect``.
- This is one of the design related code-interview questions. 
`` Of course this project can not be an answer :D btw, nothing needs to be perfect at the beginning... ``


--------------
Why URL shortening?
----------

- URL shortening is used to generate shorter variants for long URLs. 
- When users receive these short links, they are redirected to the source URL.
- People do not type short URLs incorrectly.

If we shorten the link shared below through linkshortener:

https://www.linkshortener.domain.io/link/judsuuadudaudsauidsauadsuidauisduisauidsa/

We get:

http://linkshortener.domain/i2d4

URL shortening can be used for tracking clients to analyze adverts performance.

To-Do: 
===========
1) Recaptcha and CSRF protection to all forms.
2) Write tests.
3) Develop an API interface.
4) Write better explanation for linkshortening and algorithm.
5) PEP8 and more pythonic codes.
6) Deploy on Heroku.
